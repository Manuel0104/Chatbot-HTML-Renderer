# Chat Application with HTML Rendering Feature - Project Plan

## Phase 1: Core Chat Interface and Layout ✅
- [x] Create main application layout with header and chat container
- [x] Build persistent chat input area at the bottom with send button
- [x] Implement scrollable message display area for conversation history
- [x] Add message bubbles with distinct styling for user and bot messages
- [x] Create responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

## Phase 2: Interactive HTML Rendering Feature ✅
- [x] Add "View Rendered Output" button to specific bot messages
- [x] Implement side panel toggle mechanism for HTML preview
- [x] Create secure HTML rendering component using iframe with sandbox
- [x] Add smooth animations for panel open/close interactions
- [x] Style the rendered HTML panel with proper container and borders

## Phase 3: State Management and Message Flow ✅
- [x] Build state class to manage conversation history
- [x] Implement send_message event handler for user input
- [x] Create bot_response event handler with HTML content support
- [x] Add show_html_in_panel event to control panel visibility
- [x] Test all event handlers and message flow with various scenarios
- [x] Verify HTML rendering security and display quality

## Phase 4: Chart.js and External Library Support ✅
- [x] Fix HTML rendering to support Chart.js and external JavaScript libraries
- [x] Extract external `<script src="...">` tags from HTML content
- [x] Move external scripts to `<head>` section so they load first
- [x] Wrap inline scripts in DOMContentLoaded to ensure libraries are loaded
- [x] Test with Chart.js radar charts and verify rendering
- [x] Verify support for multiple external libraries (Chart.js, Plotly, etc.)

## Implementation Summary
✅ All phases completed and tested successfully!

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Responsive Chat Interface**: Clean, modern SaaS design with purple accent colors and Poppins font
- **Message Display**: User messages on right (purple), bot messages on left (gray) with rounded bubbles
- **Persistent Input**: Fixed chat input at bottom with send button that stays accessible
- **HTML Rendering**: Bot messages can include HTML content with "Click to view HTML output" button
- **Side Panel**: Smooth sliding panel from right side to display rendered HTML content
- **Loading State**: Animated typing indicator (three bouncing dots) during bot response
- **Security**: Uses iframe with sandbox attributes for safe HTML rendering
- **Chart.js Support**: External JavaScript libraries properly loaded in `<head>` before initialization
- **State Management**: Complete event handlers for message flow, HTML rendering, and loading states

### Phase 4 Technical Details:
**Problem**: Chart.js and other external JavaScript libraries weren't rendering because:
- External `<script src="...">` tags were in the body, loading after initialization code
- This caused "Chart is not defined" errors

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Parse HTML with BeautifulSoup to extract all `<script src="...">` tags
2. Convert Tag objects to strings and move them to `<head>` section
3. Wrap inline initialization scripts in `DOMContentLoaded` event listener
4. Ensure libraries load before any code tries to use them

**Result**: Chart.js radar charts and other library-based visualizations now render perfectly!

### Testing Results:
✅ Event handlers tested and working correctly
✅ UI verified with multiple states (empty, with messages, side panel open/closed, loading)
✅ Chart.js radar chart rendering tested and verified
✅ External script extraction and reordering working correctly
✅ Responsive design verified
✅ All animations and transitions working smoothly
